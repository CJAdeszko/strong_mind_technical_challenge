Technical submission for StrongMind code challenge.

### Acceptance criteria

Create a basic application that allows creating and editing of pizzas and their associated toppings:

- It should allow me to see a list of available toppings
- It should allow me to add a new topping
- It should allow me to delete an existing topping
- It should allow me to update an existing topping
- It should not allow me to enter duplicate toppings

- It should allow me to see a list of existing pizzas and their toppings
- It should allow me to create a new pizza and add toppings to it
- It should allow me to delete an existing pizza
- It should allow me to update an existing pizza
- It should allow me to update toppings on an existing pizza
- It should not allow me to enter duplicate pizzas

### Implementation

Implemented a basic rails app which displays the list of existing pizzas on the welcome index along with buttons to navigate to the specific index for pizzas and toppings. Indexes for both pizzas and toppings contain links to create new records and update or delete existing records.

### Notes

I believe the application satisfies the basic requirement but, having tried to refrain from spending a disproportionate amount of time on the assignment and to allow room for discussion, there is some further validation and testing that I would've liked to investigate and implement. There are a couple of failing specs that I am aware of and would need more time to investigate and debug with assistance.
